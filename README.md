# Waffle Hacks Backend Challenge
Very shoddy Python GraphQL backend with a simple React frontend. Created to manage events and attendees.

## Installation
If you have `pipenv`, you'll be able to install all of the Python dependencies.  
In `frontend` you can just run `npm install` to install React and the other libraries.
